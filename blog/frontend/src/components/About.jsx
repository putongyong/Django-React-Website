        About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
          As a PhD researcher in Modern Philosophy in Paris, my expertise lies in the areas of 17th and 18th century continental philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of law. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my research experience in philosophy, I have developed a strong interest in web development and aspire to work as a full-stack web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2022, I have completed courses on FreeCodeCamp and Coursera, which have allowed me to acquire skills in various areas of web development. Starting with front-end skills such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I gradually explored libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and React. My interest in back-end development grew, and I became particularly fascinated with Python. This led me to learn Django, which I find to be a compelling framework for managing URLs, SQL databases, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for React and Django has made them my primary technologies for web development. You can check out my projects and daily coding activities on my Github page at https://github.com/putongyong.
