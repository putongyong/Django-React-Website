# Django-React-Website

This is my first full-stack project using ReactJS as the frontend framework and Django/Python as the backend framework. Other frameworks and libraries utilized in this project include Bootstrap, Axios, and React-Router-Dom.

During the development of this project, I aimed to create a template that can be easily adapted for future use. The template is primarily designed for a website that consists of a blogging section and an e-commerce platform. It can function as a blogging website where the blog owner can sell their products, or as an e-commerce website where a company can showcase their brand, products, and ideas through the blog section.

I also intend to utilize this template for my personal blog or portfolio and deploy it online. Although it has not yet been deployed, visitors can preview this project by following these steps:

git clone https://github.com/putongyong/Django-React-Website

cd Django-React-Website

cd blog

python manage.py runserver
